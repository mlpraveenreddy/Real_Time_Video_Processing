# Real-Time-Video-Processing
In this project,we take a video input from a HDMI source and convert it to a grayscale VGA output using Zybo FPGA.We use some of the IP cores provided by https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-library. We write a vhdl code for the Video Processing block to convert the color input to a grayscale output.We create a block design for the entire process and include the VideoProcessing module in the block design.The connections are made appropriately and then we generate a wrapper for the design.
